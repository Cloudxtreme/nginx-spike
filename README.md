Experimenting with Nginx for
+ DoS protecting/rate limiting
+ Caching
+ Reverse proxying

Vert.x as a simple application backend
JMeter as a test harness

See `server/README.md` for how to get the back-end application server running
See `nginx/README.md` for installing Nginx and the config to act as a cache/DoS protection
See `test/README.md` for the simple JMeter tests I've used to stress the system
